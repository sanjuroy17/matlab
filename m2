% Define the radii of the circles 
R2 = 6.5;  % radius of circle C2 in mm 
R4 = 9.5;  % radius of circle C4 in mm 
% Calculate the distance between the centers of C2 and C4 
distance = R2 + R4; 
% Display the result 
disp(['The distance between the centers of C2 and C4 is: ', num2str(distance), ' mm']);
